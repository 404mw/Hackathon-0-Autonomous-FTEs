# Business Handover & CEO Briefing

The Business Handover feature transforms your AI Employee from reactive to proactive.

## Key Feature: The "Business Handover"

1. **The Trigger:** A scheduled task runs every Sunday night
2. **The Process:** Claude reads `Business_Goals.md`, checks `Tasks/Done` for the week, and checks `Bank_Transactions.md`
3. **The Deliverable:** A "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" highlighting:
   - **Revenue:** Total earned this week
   - **Bottlenecks:** Tasks that took too long
   - **Proactive Suggestion:** "I noticed we spent $200 on software we don't use; shall I cancel the subscription?"
