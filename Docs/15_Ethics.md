# Ethics & Responsible Automation

With great automation comes great responsibility.

## When Should AI NOT Act Autonomously?

- **Emotional contexts:** Condolence messages, conflict resolution, sensitive negotiations
- **Legal matters:** Contract signing, legal advice, regulatory filings
- **Medical decisions:** Health-related actions affecting you or others
- **Financial edge cases:** Unusual transactions, new recipients, large amounts
- **Irreversible actions:** Anything that cannot be easily undone

## Transparency Principles

- **Disclose AI involvement:** When your AI sends emails, consider adding a signature noting AI assistance
- **Maintain audit trails:** All actions should be logged and reviewable
- **Allow opt-out:** Give contacts a way to request human-only communication
- **Regular reviews:** Schedule weekly reviews of AI decisions to catch drift

## Privacy Considerations

1. **Minimize data collection:** Only capture what's necessary
2. **Local-first:** Keep sensitive data on your machine when possible
3. **Encryption at rest:** Consider encrypting your Obsidian vault
4. **Third-party caution:** Understand what data leaves your system via APIs

## The Human Remains Accountable

You are responsible for your AI Employee's actions. The automation runs on your behalf, using your credentials, acting in your name. Regular oversight isn't optional — it's essential.

### Suggested Oversight Schedule

1. **Daily:** 2-minute dashboard check
2. **Weekly:** 15-minute action log review
3. **Monthly:** 1-hour comprehensive audit
4. **Quarterly:** Full security and access review
