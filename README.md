# Hackathon 0: Autonomous FTEs

**Your life and business on autopilot. Local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop.**

A Personal AI Employee — an autonomous Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) built with **Claude Code** and **Obsidian**. It proactively manages personal and business affairs 24/7: triaging emails, handling WhatsApp messages, generating invoices, auditing bank transactions, and delivering Monday Morning CEO Briefings.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Knowledge Base | Obsidian (Local Markdown) |
| Logic Engine | Claude Code |
| External Integration | MCP Servers (Node.js/Python) |
| Automation | Python Orchestrator + Watchers |

## Architecture

- **Local-first** — all data stays in an Obsidian vault on your machine
- **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)** — file-based approval system prevents AI accidents
- **Agent Skills** — every AI capability is a reusable, packaged skill
- **Audit logging** — every action is logged to structured JSON

## Tier Progression

| Tier | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Bronze | Vault setup, one watcher, basic triage |
| Silver | Multiple watchers, invoice generation, CEO briefings |
| Gold | MCP servers, payment automation, full orchestration |
| Platinum | Multi-agent coordination, self-healing, always-on |
